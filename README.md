About info-beamer
=================

info-beamer allows you to develop interactive information displays using
the Lua programming language.

This is a fork of the abandoned project by [dividuum](https://github.com/dividuum/info-beamer.git).

Please understand that I can not provide support for this project as it is
just a hobby project in my spare time.
